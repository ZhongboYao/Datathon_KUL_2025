The plan aims to cut energy consumption per unit of GDP by 3-5% per year. It also aims at increasing the share of renewable energy to 16% by 2030, and transport fuel from alternative sources such as gas or biofuels to 20% by 2020. The plan contains data on the greenhouse gas emissions in the Czech Republic, including projections of future development, and presents proposals for concrete measures to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and for adaptation measures. The programme was reviewed in 2007, and the review adopted by the government in April 2008. The review pointed to significant increase in the use of renewable energy sources, as well as progress in the agriculture and water management sectors. However, it found the Czech Republics energy intensity and GHG emissions per capita were comparatively high, and that transport sector emissions continued to increase. The National Climate Change Plan is thus being reviewed to emphasise measures targeting the industry and transport sectors, which contribute the most to GHG emissions, as well as to take into account the evolution of domestic, European and global political negotiations on climate change since 2004.

The state targets the installation of 1 to 1.2 GW of solar capacity by 2022, seeks to enhance energy security, create jobs in the solar manufacturing and become a main exporter of renewable power to third party and neighboring states. To reach such targets, the solar policy includes a combination of support tools: First, power producers are exempted from electricity duty on the energy they consume and can apply for incentives under the Industry Scheme. Producers of solar thermal energy are granted access to the water quantity required for generation by local authorities and solar power will be guaranteed grid access under both the Indian Solar Mission and the Rajasthan Solar policy. The solar policy seeks to widespread the installation of solar water heating systems on all industrial buildings where hot water is required, large residential buildings, government and private hospitals, hotels and swimming pools. Solar steam systems in residential institutions and hospitals will also be supported. Second, the solar policy creates the RE infrastructure Development Fund to finance transmission network extension, road construction and ease the integration of RE generation. Such Fund will be financed by the collection of a development charge of INR. 10 Lacs per MW installed transfered to the Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation. The policy also provides for the regulation framework to develop solar parks larger than 1, 000 MW capacity. Such Parks will include Solar Power Plants, Manufacturing Zones, R &amp; D and Training Centres. Third, the Solar Policy creates the Solar Research Center of excellence. The solar policy will fulfill Rajasthan s engagements in the National Solar Mission -install 66 MW of solar capacity- and install additional capacity following a competitive bidding process.

          "European Energy Security Strategy European Union (27) (2014)&quot;Today, the EU imports 53% of the energy it consumes. Energy import dependency relates to crude oil (almost 90%), to natural gas (66%), and to a lesser extent to solid fuels (42%) as well as nuclear fuel (40%).&quot;\n&quot;EU energy security has also to be seen in the context of growing energy demand worldwide, which is expected to increase by 27% by 2030, with important changes to energy supply and trade flows.\nModerating energy demand is one of the most effective tools to reduce the EU&#039;s external energy dependency and exposure to price hikes. The current situation adds urgency to the previously agreed EU energy efficiency target of 20% that will result in 371 Mtoe primary energy savings in 2020 compared to projections.&quot;\n&quot;Energy demand in the building sector, responsible for about 40% of energy consumption in the EU and a third of natural gas use could be cut by up to three quarters if the renovation of buildings is speeded up.&quot;\n&quot;In March 2014, the European Council conclusions called for: &quot;Speedy implementation of all the measures to meet the target of achieving interconnection of at least 10 % of their installed electricity production capacity for all Member States”. Currently, the average interconnection level stands at about 8%. Taking into account the importance of interconnectors for strengthening security of supply and the need to facilitate cross-border trade, the European Commission proposes to extend the current 10% interconnection target to 15% by 2030 while taking into account the cost aspects and the potential of commercial exchanges in the relevant regions.&quot;\n&quot;In 2012, energy from renewable sources was estimated to have contributed 14.1% of EU final energy consumption and should reach the objective of 20% in 2020. Looking beyond 2020, the Commission has proposed to increase the share of renewable energy to at least 27% by 2030.&quot;\n&quot;Coal and lignite&#039;s CO2-emissions mean that they only have a long-term future in the EU if using Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). CCS also offers the potential to further improve gas and oil recovery that would otherwise remain untapped. Therefore, bearing in mind the rather limited uptake of CCS to date, further efforts in research, development and deployment should be made in order to fully benefit from this technology.&quot;\n&quot;The Union&#039;s energy security is inseparable from the 2030 framework for climate and energy and should be agreed together by the European Council. The transition to a competitive, low-carbon economy will reduce the use of imported fossil fuels by moderating energy demand and exploiting renewable and other indigenous sources of energy.&quot; (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=celex:52014DC0330)",

For example:\n- energy distributors or retail energy sales companies have to achieve 1.5% energy savings per year through the implementation of energy efficiency measures\n- EU countries can opt to achieve the same level of savings through other means such as improving the efficiency of heating systems, installing double glazed windows or insulating roofs\n- the public sector in EU countries should purchase energy efficient buildings, products and services\n- every year, EU governments will carry out energy efficient renovations on at least 3% of the buildings they own and occupy by floor area\n- empowering energy consumers to better manage consumption. This includes easy and free access to data on consumption through individual metering\n- national incentives for SMEs to undergo energy audits\n- large companies will make audits of their energy consumption to help them identify ways to reduce it\n- monitoring efficiency levels in new energy generation capacities&quot; (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1399375464230&amp;uri=CELEX:32012L0027)\nIn 2018, as part of the &#039;Clean energy for all Europeans package&#039;, the amending Directive on Energy Efficiency (2018/2002) was agreed to update the policy framework to 2030 and beyond. Its key element is a headline energy efficiency target for 2030 of at least 32.5%. The target, to be achieved collectively across the EU, is set relative to the 2007 modelling projections for 2030.\nIn absolute terms, this means that EU energy consumption for 2030 should be no more than 1128 Mtoe (million tonnes of equivalent) of primary energy and/or no more than 846 Mtoe of final energy (following the withdrawal of the UK).\nThe amending directive also includes an extension to the energy savings obligation in end use, introduced in the 2012 directive. Under the amending directive, EU countries will have to achieve new energy savings of 0.8% each year of final energy consumption for the 2021-2030 period, except Cyprus and Malta that will have to achieve 0.24% each year instead.\nThe directive entered into force in December 2018 and had to be transposed into national law by Member States by 25 June 2020, except for metering and billing provisions which has a different deadline (25 October 2020).",

          "Carbon Price Floor United Kingdom (2013)The Carbon Price Floor (CPF) is a UK Government policy implemented to support the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). The CPF taxes fossil fuels used to generate electricity via Carbon Price Support rates set under the Climate Change Levy. The price floor consists of two components which are paid for by energy generators in two different ways: (i) The EU ETS allowance price; and (ii) the Carbon Support Price (CPS), which tops up the EU ETS allowance prices, as projected by the Government, to the carbon floor price target.\nAt Budget 2014 the Government announced that the CPS component of the floor price would be capped at a maximum of £18/tCO2 from 2016 to 2020 to limit the competitive disadvantage faced by business and reduce energy bills for consumers. This price freeze was extended to 2021 in Budget 2016.",

The plan acts as a national strategic guide for policy and governance until the next presidential elections in 2019. The plan is divided into five sections, the fifth of which is titled “Preserve life on the planet and save the human species” and speaks directly to environmental protections and climate change. The plan lists 12 broad and ambitious goals in relation to climate ranging from elaborating both mitigation and adaptation plans, to a number of objectives that pressure industrialised countries to follow through on international commitments and pay their “climate debt” in the form of reparations to less developed countries.\n&quot;The plan also lists a series of national policies and associated programmes (which appear to be primary possible strategic actions) related to the energy sector, environmental conservation and transport. For those policies related to climate change, it is unclear which programs are already n execution or ready for implementation.&quot;\n(Source: http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/law/law-of-the-plan-for-the-homeland-the-second-socialist-plan-of-social-and-economic-development-of-the-nation-2013-2019/)",
